  - Welcome back Detective.
  - I'm assuming your wanting to know about where I was when Aaron was killed
  - Well I'll be honest it's not gonna look good for me.
  - I wont be able to provide an alibi or anything, everyone else in my house is
    sound asleep when I go for my walks.
  - That morning when I was out for my daily morning walk and when I got to Aarons
    house I saw all the ruckus
  - That's all I know about it really, sorry I can't be of anymore help.
