  - Welcome back Detective.
  - Another very sad situation.
  - Aaron was a good man and a great help when Peter was killed.
  - 'I''m guessing you are looking into the other candidates '
  - Although if i were you i would be looking into Cory.
  - He's Aaron's brother and from what Aaron told me they have been figting quite
    a bit.
  - Mostly about the inheritance from their parents.
  - He didn't give me all the details just that.
  - Have a good day.
