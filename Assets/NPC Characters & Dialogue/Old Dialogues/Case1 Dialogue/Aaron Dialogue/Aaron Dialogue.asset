  - lcome to our small town of Elmwoodoming. Welcome to our small town of Elmwood
  - I am Mayor Aaron
  - The reason we have called you here is that there has been a murder
  - 'The local baker Peter was found stabbed in the middle of his Bakery two mornings
    ago '
  - Our town is so small so we don't have any police of our own which is why we asked
    you to come here.
  - You know in small towns everyone knows everyone else's business.
  - So I think the best way for you to find out what happened is to walk around and
    talk to the villagers.
