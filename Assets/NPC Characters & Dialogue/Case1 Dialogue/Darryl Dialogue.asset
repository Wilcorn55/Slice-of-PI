  - 'Um I don''t know what happened that morning he always started early in order
    to get all the baking done. '
  - 'When I came in at my normal time I found him dead. '
  - 'There was nothing missing so it definitely wasn''t a robbery gone wrong or anything
    like that. '
  - That's all I really know, sorry I can't be of any help.
