  - How are you doing? I'm Thea.
  - Terrible situation isn't it.
  - I'm gonna be honest with you. I think Peter was cheating on Charlotte.
  - You see I'm rather good friends with Charlotte and when I've been round at her
    house I noticed that he's become rather protective of his phone.
  - ' I don''t think that Charlotte has suspected anything and I hope it''s not true.
    But it''s just a gut feeling I have.'
