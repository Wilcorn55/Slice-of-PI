  - Hey how's it going you must be the detective, such a sad situation. Charlotte
    is just heartbroken.
  - Oh sorry I'm Sally, Charlotte and I have been best friends since we were kids.
  - Waking up that morning to the news was just horrible. I raced over to comfort
    Charlotte as soon as I heard.
  - 'I can''t believe that someone in our community would be capable of that, it''s
    so scary. '
  - 'Please find out who did this.  '
  - 'If i''m honest i think it might have been Darryl, i mean he has a good motive
    with Peter out the way he gets all of the bakeries profits. '
  - But that's just my two cents.
