  - Oh Hi, You must be the Detective, thanks for coming.
  - I'm Charlotte, Peter's wife. Please find out who did this to my husband.
  - I don't really know anything, all i could tell you is that the past couple of
    days Peter was pretty distant.
  - Once again please figure out what happened here, I don't want anyone else in
    this town to go through what i'm going through.
