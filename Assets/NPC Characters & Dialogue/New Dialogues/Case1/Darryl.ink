Peter and I ran the bakery together, he ran the day to day and did all the baking and I ran the business side.

I don't know what I'm gonna do now that he's gone. ->DONE

Um, I don't know what happened that morning, he always started early in order to get all the baking done.

When I came in at my usual time I found him dead.

There was nothing missing so it definitely wasn't a robbery gone wrong or anything like that.

That's all I really know, sorry I can't be of any help.
