  - Welcome back Detective
  - Been an interesting couple of years since you were last here.
  - I've got a new baker, and I'm running for Mayor
  - and of course our the reason your back.
  - Well I can tell you, these days every morning I go into the bakery early to help
    out with the prep
  - Just ask Russel he also comes in and helps out and was there that morning.
  - If i were you my suspicions would be on the other two.
  - I was in last by a long shot in the polls
  - 'I believe it went first Aaron, second Jonothan and third Michael '
  - It was a pretty close race as well, now it seems like a bit of a coin flip between
    the other two
  - Anyways I wont take up any more of your time, have a good one
