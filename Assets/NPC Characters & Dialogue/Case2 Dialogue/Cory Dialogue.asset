  - Hey man whats up I'm Cory.
  - Oh your the Detective.
  - I'm guessing you already know that I'm, well was Aarons brother
  - And you probably know that we had been fighting recently.
  - It was because our Father passed a couple of months ago and I was given the entirety
    of the inheritance
  - and Aaron was not happy about that.
  - Over the last 2 months he has really been on me about him deserving some
  - 'I kept telling him that it''s just what Dad wanted, '
  - I'm not sure why Dad did what he did but he did say in the will to not give anything
    to Aaron
  - I was just trying to follow my Dad's final wish's
  - I don't think there is anything else that i can help you with.
